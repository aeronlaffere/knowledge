# TypeScript

TypeScript builds on JavaScript by adding a [type system](../../programming/type-system.md). This is fantastically useful because it helps you write code in which errors can be caught early on (such as attempting to add a number to a string, i.e., two different types) and makes code easier to interpret by reading alone.

TypeScript is a much younger language than JavaScript so is not adopted everywhere. However, if you're thinking of developing a new project in JavaScript and you have a choice, you should be using TypeScript.

## Learning TypeScript

I began my journey with TypeScript by starting a new project - often the best way to learn - using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), a web framework which has TypeScript support. The web framework space is an active one and many alternatives existed but the Svelte framework seemed to have the most excitement around it when I started looking, plus it promised rapid development speed which was a priority as I was on a tight deadline.

TypeScript was developed by Microsoft who also provide [documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).
