# This is everything I know

This project was inspired by seeing how brilliantly [nikitavoloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) implemented the idea. I think I also owe something to Maggie Appleton's [essay on digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) for first developing my interest in projects like this. I hope the pages herein will come to pay due homage to the many other influences great and small I am indebted to.

## Wait, where are the notes?

I am just getting started making this. I developed much of my ethical thinking through engagement with open source software communities as a young adolescent, and as such I believe strongly in building openly and being unpretentious about sharing work in progress. I also think it's okay to look stupid in public from time to time â€“- smart people tend to begin by asking stupid questions.

Ultimately, I hope the things I accumulate here are at least useful to me in keeping track of the dizzying inflow of information I encounter each day. If they help you also then please consider starring this repository or leaving a message to let me know what you liked.
